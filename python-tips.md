### creating a package in a folder

create the folder

can create classes and functions within individual files

Can then import as a compound call ie:
    from <folder>.<filename> import <function>


If you want to import the whole collection in one go, ie:
    import <folder>

Need to have an __init__.py file in which you import all the individual packages
