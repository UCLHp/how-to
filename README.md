Guide to get Git working with Atom (from Callum)

The master guide - needs additional help thoug

If there are issues with the proxy, open Git Bash and type:
git config --global http.proxy http://<username>:<password>@<proxy-server-url>:<port>

Seems like if you create a repo in Atom, you still need to initialise externally
> Open github.com and create the appropriately named repository
> Open GitBash
> navigate to the directory of the repository
> run the command
> git remote add origin git@github.com:<username>/<repositor>.git

Some potentially useful tutorials I found online:

 - The basic operations of Git, done on a Mac so using the command line but the principle is sound: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKg7e37bQE
 - Adding an existing directory of code to a repository: https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/
 - proxy settings: https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum/t/git-behind-a-proxy-server/13187
